FUTURE RESEARCH QUESTIONS FOR YOURSELF
======================================
1. Extending fast swap on how many jobs can 
co-exist decently on a particular compute node 
oversubscribing cache space for local memory?
It depends on locality patterns of the apps,
we find a balanced mixture of apps that can 
do well with fixed amount of local memory
as cache.

2. A kernel-based interface that allows for 
application-runtime co-design. Providing perf 
benefits of userspace runtimes while generality 
and sharing benefits of kernel-based 
implementation. but what's lacking in 
remote regions?

3. Propose a proper hardware architecture for
disaggregation. What's the right amount of 
local memory? Why does it have to be small/big?
It is supposedly small because it's not counting 
towards app memory and hence extra cost. 
The other side of argument is DRAM is cheap now,
so why not; disaggregation is more to overcome 
dram limits on a single server than to save 
memory. what's right here?
