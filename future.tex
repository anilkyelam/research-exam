FUTURE RESEARCH QUESTIONS FOR YOURSELF
======================================
1. Extending fast swap on how many jobs can 
co-exist decently on a particular compute node 
oversubscribing cache space for local memory?
It depends on locality patterns of the apps,
we find a balanced mixture of apps that can 
do well with fixed amount of local memory
as cache.

2. A kernel-based interface that allows for 
application-runtime co-design. Providing perf 
benefits of userspace runtimes while generality 
and sharing benefits of kernel-based 
implementation. but what's lacking in 
remote regions?

3.
